A tight budget has forced councils to close the non-profit services they provide including public toilets.
However, officials in the British Toilets Association argued that people's life and well-being also may be well affected without public toilets.
In my opinion, **rather than closing** the public toilets, **councils should work** out the problem with other solutions.

Whether to use human flesh search **has widely aroused the public's attention**.
**Supporters believe that** human flesh search makes it  possible to punish criminals and keep justice online.
**However, some argue that** it has violated people's privacy.
In my view, human flesh search is not righteous and should never be abused.

An office romance **has always been a controversial topic** since the day it was born.
It used to be a taboo, but it is thrilling.
**The supporters believe** it saves both time and money, because the workers no longer need to hunt for a lover outside the workplace.
However, **the opponents of an office romance argue that** the couples' constant contact would cause conflicts, as they do not have private time.
In my opinion, I do not think office romances should be encouraged though the have certain benefits.
There are reasons from two aspects.

Gun shots, gang fights and peers bullying in the campus in U.S. are reported now and then. 
In China, some of these problems are actually more and more prominent.
**Given this context, to stop campus violence**, I think **it is best to set** up a proactive counseling scheme, consisting of case workers and psychological professionals.

As can be seen in the picture, a little girl with pigtails is picking up trash along the seashore, which is littered by lots of foam boxes.
The basket on her back has already been filled with trash.
Apparently, the picture intends to remind us of the serious issue of turning the beautiful seashore into a dumping ground.
In my oponion, the authorities concerned must tak some necessary measures to address this problem.

The bar chart illustrates the average amounts of time that students spend on physical activity per day in three countries.
As can be seen, American students spend the most time on physical activity, with 72 minutes per day, followed by South Korean students, with 42 minutes.
Chinese students on average spend only 12 minutes doing physical exercise per day.

Firstly, councils can co-operate with the local towns or NGOs or charities t transfer responsibilities for running the toilets to them. 
This can **save a great many public inconvenience from closure** and **ease the burden of toilet costs on councils**.
By sharing the burden of toilets with other organizations, **a huge sum can be spared and put to more constructive uses**.

Next, to help reduce future running costs, councils may make improvements to facilities, including energy and water saving measures.

In addition, charges should be introduced and the public should prepare to pay for using public toilets to ensure that they remain open.
The income from those toilets will kept to pay for running costs.

Firstly, human flesh search is a **problematic approach** **for the reason that** it **leads to the abuse of power**.
In many cases, the person being searched is treated illegally and brutally by netizens who expose their personal information unrestrictedly in the name of justice.

Furthermore, human flesh search has **gone beyond simply posting pictures and news**, it is a potent weapon that often leads to "cyberbullying".
In China, for instance, after being exposed the phone number, address and workplace, victims may receive hundreds of phone calls cursing them and even death threats for what they have done.

It is also important to note that there are many cases where the family members of these victims are also laid bare to the public.
Even if the person at the center of the human flesh search did something wrong, what crime did their family commit? Why do they need to be punished?

As for the companies, office romances **are against work ethic**, for the staffs in love may **take advantage of their positions for private gains**.
The lovers may **pretend working for the company** while they are in fact **appropriating the public funds for personal use**.
Still, office romances can cause jealousy and gossip among other staffs.
On the whole, the working efficiency of the whole department is reduced.

As for indivisuals, office romances are often quite challenging.
The lovers must restrain themselves even when they see their partner flirted by other staffs so as not to expose their secret office romance.
What's worse, if the relationship fails, the careers of the workers in love would be harmed.

First of all, this counciling scheme takes preemptive measures to nib the bud of violence before it is too late.
We do not wait for the problems to happen.
Instead, we **detect some signs of violence and pinpoint the offenders**, who will be subject to mandatory counseling.
Through professional sessions, these violent offenders could be contained an managed in a measured and progressive manner.

Second, counseling scheme is also accessible to those potential victims of campus violence.
Usually, being afraid of the retaliation from reporting the violence offence, victims keep silent and suppress their feelings.
The mangnitude of offence is thus growing without external intervention.
If a counseling scheme is set up, victimes can turn to it for guidance and help.
They are able to get the psychological sessions and possible intervention could be staged before it is too late.

First, rubbish bins need to be placed properly and sufficiently along the seashore.
Sometimes, the reason why people litter is not because they want to do so, but they could not find rubbish bins on the site.
If rubbish bins are handily around, I am sure that most people would put the trash in the right place.

Second, those who litter in the seashore should be fined and they should should also be subject to community service as a form of retribution.
This would send a strong message to potential wrongdoers.

Firstly, when you order in fast food restaurants, chances are that you can get easy access to salad, vegetable sup and other low-calorie food.
So eating western fast food does not neccessarily lead to obesity and other chronic health problems.
Instead of imposing a ban, the key lies in finding a way to strike a balance in one's diet and avoid over-consumption of any food.
After all, it depends on you to decide whether to take those high-calorie food or to choose low calorie healthy food on the  menu.

Secondly, people are willing to take fast food because of the genetal concern of food safety.
There are countless Chinese food restaurants standing on the side of the road without government control over safety standards.
The western food restaurants, such as KFC and McDonalds, however, have strict quality control, which guarantees safe and healthy food for the customers.

It is not surprisng to note that Chinese students are the least engaged in physical activities in the three countries, as they are too preoccupied with their study.
This is, however, not good for Chinese students' physical health.
To address this issue, schools in China are advised to set an upper limit on students' homework assignments. 
Besides, more physical activities could be organized by schools.
Monthly themed activities, for example, are a good way to encourage student to try different kinds of physical activities.

To sum up, public toilets have great importance, whether in regard to people's well-being, social inclusion and harmony.
Therefore, more measures should  be taken to maintain the public toilets and other facilities.

In conclusion, although the majority of netizens abhor evil and injustice, the practice of using violence to solve violence is not the right way for a civilized society.
I believe human flesh search should be regulated strictly.

In a word, dating a cowoker is more harmful than beneficial under most circumstances.

In conclusion, I think a campis-based counseling scheme is helpful and beneficial to prevent, intervene and eliminate violence.

In short, the systemic placement of rubbish bins and effective law enforcement would help restore the natural beauty on the seaside.

In conclusion, western fast food is not as evil as we think.
In fact, what underlines a health body is your awareness of balanced diet and appropriate exercises, rather than resisting fast food.
