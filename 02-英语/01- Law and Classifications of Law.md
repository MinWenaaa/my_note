"In its majestic equality," said the author Anatole France in 1894, "the law forbbids the rich and the poor alick to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread."

In a typical democracy, the central institutions for interpreting an creating law are the three main branches of government, namely an impartial judiciary, a democratic legislature, and aan accountable executive.

To implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public, a government's bureaucracy, the military and police are vital.

While all this organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, and independent legal profession and a vibrant cicil society will support their progress.

## Classifications of Law
There are several different ways in which laws can be classified, depending on the criteria or characteristic
按照不同的标准或特征，法可以根据不同的方法进行分类。

### a. Substantive Law vs. Procedural Law
实体法与程序法

Substantive law explains what you can and cannot do.
实体法规定何为可为之事，何为不可为之事。

For example, the law states that you cannot murdur another human being unless it was in self defense, you were under duress, or if you were drugged by another person.

Unlike substantive law, procedural laws are just the steps that must take place when filing a lawsuit against anothor party.

### b. Public Law vs. Private Law
公法与私法

Law can be divided into two main branches: (1) public law and(2) private law. 

Public law is the body of law dealing with the relations between private individuals and the government, and with the structue and operation of the government itself, including consitutional law, criminal law, and administrative law.

Private law is the body of law dealing with private persons and their property and relationships.

### c. Criminal Law vs. Civil Law
刑法和民法

Criminal law or penal law defines breaches of duty to society at large.

It is society, through government employees called prosecutors(such as district attorneys), that brings court action against violators. 

If you are found guilty of a crime such as theft, you will be punished by imprisonment or a fine.

Civil law, as opposed to criminal law, is the branch of law dealing with disputes between individuals or organizations, in which compensation may be awarded to the victims.

For instance, if a car crash victim claims damages against the driver for loss or injury sustained in an accident, this will be a civil law case.

### Common Law vs. Civil Law
普通法和大陆法

Common law is law developed by judges through decisions of courts and similar tribunals rather than through legislative statutes or executive branch action.

Common law countries prosecute with the concept of "stare decisis", which means that these countries such as the United States of Amarica make decisions based on presedents.

Because each judicial opinion serves as a precedent for later decisions, as a result, common law id sometimes called *judge-made law*.

Anglo-American law is rooted in the tradition of the common law.

In 1881, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. wrote, "The life of the law has not been logic: It has been experience."

Common law developed as a response to the need to find solutions to the pressing issues of the time.

Unlike common law, the principle of civil law is to provide all citizens with an accessible and written collection of the laws which apply to them and which judges must follow.

# Lesson 2 Legal Systems: Common Law and Civil Law

## 1. Common-law System

Under a common-law system, disputes are settled through an adversarial exchanged of arguments and evidence.

Both parties produce their evidencesor argument before a netural fact finder, either a judge or a jury.

The judge or jury evaluates the evidence, applies the appropriate law to the cases, and renders a judgment or verdict in favor of one of the parties.

Following the decision, eitherr party may appeal the decision to a higher court.

Appellate courts in a common-law system may review only findings of law, not determinations of fact.

The lawmaking role of legislatures in common law countries has increased greatly during the 1900's.

In additiion, consitutional law in these countries continues the common-law tradition of defending the people's rights and liberties.

## 2. Civil-law System

Civil-law systems are based mainly on statutes.

The majority of civil-law countries have assembled their statutes into one or maore carefully organized collections called codes.

Most mordern law codes can be traced back to the famous code the was commissioned by the Roman Emperor Justinian I in the A.D.500's.

It affects legal rules, legalthought, legal classifications, the treatment of legal precedents and techniques, anf the organizations of court systems.

The civil codes of both countries have proven particularly adaptable.
