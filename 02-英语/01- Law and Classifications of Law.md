## Classifications of Law
There are several different ways in which laws can be classified, depending on the criteria or characteristic
按照不同的标准或特征，法可以根据不同的方法进行分类。

### a. Substantive Law vs. Procedural Law
实体法与程序法

Substantive law explains what you can and cannot do.
实体法规定何为可为之事，何为不可为之事。

For example, the law states that you cannot murdur another human being unless it was in self defense, you were under duress, or if you were drugged by another person.
例如规定不得谋害性命（除非处于自卫、受到胁迫或处于醉态）的法律即属实体法。

Unlike substantive law, procedural laws are just the steps that must take place when filing a lawsuit against anothor party.
与实体法不同，程序法的内容是指一方提起诉讼时应当遵循的步骤。

### b. Public Law vs. Private Law
公法与私法

Law can be divided into two main branches: (1) public law and(2) private law. 
法可划分为两大部门：公法和私法。

Public law is the body of law dealing with the relations between private individuals and the government, and with the structue and operation of the government itself, including consitutional law, criminal law, and administrative law.
公法是调整个人与政府间关系的法律，同时还规定政府自身框架及其运作，公法包括宪法、刑法和行政法。

Private law is the body of law dealing with private persons and their property and relationships.
私法是调整私人、私人财产以及私人之间关系的法律。

### c. Criminal Law vs. Civil Law
刑法和民法

Criminal law or penal law defines breaches of duty to society at large.
刑法规制的是危害整个社会的行为（违反对社会承担的义务）。

It is society, through government employees called prosecutors(such as district attorneys), that brings court action against violators. 
社会通过称作“检察官”（如“地区检察官”）的政府官员，对违法者提起诉讼。

If you are found guilty of a crime such as theft, you will be punished by imprisonment or a fine.
行为人被判为有罪（如盗窃罪）的，可以被处以监禁刑或罚金刑。

Civil law, as opposed to criminal law, is the branch of law dealing with disputes between individuals or organizations, in which compensation may be awarded to the victims.
与刑法不同，民法调整的是个人间、法人间或个人与法人间的争议，通常受害者会判得赔偿金。

For instance, if a car crash victim claims damages against the driver for loss or injury sustained in an accident, this will be a civil law case.
例如，车祸中的受害人如向司机主张事故损失或伤害赔偿金的，就是一则民事案件。

### Common Law vs. Civil Law
普通法和大陆法

Common law is law developed by judges through decisions of courts and similar tribunals rather than through legislative statutes or executive branch action.
普通法是由法官通过法院（即类似裁判机构）的判决发展起来，而非通过立法机关制定的制定法，或者行政机构的决定发展起来。

Common law countries prosecute with the concept of "stare decisis", which means that these countries such as the United States of Amarica make decisions based on presedents.
普通法国家实行“遵循先例”的原则，也就是说，美国等普通法国家是基于先例做出裁决的。

Because each judicial opinion serves as a precedent for later decisions, as a result, common law id sometimes called *judge-made law*.
因为每一司法一键

Anglo-American law is rooted in the tradition of the common law.

In 1881, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. wrote, "The life of the law has not been logic: It has been experience."

Common law developed as a response to the need to find solutions to the pressing issues of the time.

Unlike common law, the principle of civil law is to provide all citizens with an accessible and written collection of the laws which apply to them and which judges must follow.

# Lesson 2 Legal Systems: Common Law and Civil Law

Every independent country hat its own legal system.

The systems vary according to each country's social traditions and form of goverment.

But most systems can be classed as either a common-law system or a civil-law system.

Many countries combine features of both systems.

A general distinction can be made between civil law jurisdictions, which codify their laws, and common law systems, where judge made law is not consolidated.

## 1. Common-law System

The common-law system is used in all the states of the United States expect Louisana, where French Civil Law combined with English Criminal Law to form a hybrid system.

Common-law courts base thei decisions on prior judicial pronouncements rather than on legislative enactments.

Common-law judges rely on their predecessors' decisions of actual controversies, rather than on abstract codes or texts, to guide them in applying the law.

Conmmon-law judges find the grounds for their decisions in law reports, which contain decisions of past controversies.

Under the doctrine of *stare decisis*, common-law judges are obliged to adhere to previously decided cases, or precedents, where the facts are substantially the same.

A court's decision id binding authority for similar cases going to be decided by the same court or by lower courts within the same jurisdiction.

The decision is not binding on courts of higher rank within that jurisdiction or courts in other jurisdictions, but it may be considered as persuasive authority.

Under a common-law system, disputes are settled through an adversarial exchanged of arguments and evidence.

Both parties produce their evidencesor argument before a netural fact finder, either a judge or a jury.

The judge or jury evaluates the evidence, applies the appropriate law to the cases, and renders a judgment or verdict in favor of one of the parties.

Following the decision, eitherr party may appeal the decision to a higher court.

Appellate courts in a common-law system may review only findings of law, not determinations of fact.

The lawmaking role of legislatures in common law countries has increased greatly during the 1900's.

In additiion, consitutional law in these countries continues the common-law tradition of defending the people's rights and liberties.

## 2. Civil-law System

Civil-law systems are based mainly on statutes.

The majority of civil-law countries have assembled their statutes into one or maore carefully organized collections called codes.

Most mordern law codes can be traced back to the famous code the was commissioned by the Roman Emperor Justinian I in the A.D.500's.

It affects legal rules, legalthought, legal classifications, the treatment of legal precedents and techniques, anf the organizations of court systems.

The civil codes of both countries have proven particularly adaptable.
