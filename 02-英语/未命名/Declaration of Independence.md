**When** in the Course of Human Event, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate an equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind **requires that** they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.
在人类事务的发展过程中，当一个民族必须解除与另一个民族之间所存在的政治联系，并依据自然法则及自然之神的旨意，在世界各国之间，采取独立和平等的地位时，出于对人类意见的正当尊重，有必要宣布他们不得不分离的原因。



We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.
我们认为下面这些真理是不证自明的，人人生而平等，造物主赋予他们若干不可剥夺的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利。
That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
为了保障这些权利，人们建立了政府，其正当权力来自被统治者的同意。每当任何形式的政府破坏这些目标时，人民有权改变或废除它，并建立新的政府。新政府建立在最优可能确保他们的安全和幸福的原则之上，并以他们认为最能实现这些目标的形式组织其权利。
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed.
实际上，慎重的做法是，对于长期建立的政府，不应该因为轻微和短暂的原因而改变；因此，所有的经验都表明，人类更倾向于忍受，只要恶行是可以忍受的，就不愿意废除已经习惯的形式而纠正它。
But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throe off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security.
但是，当一系列滥用职权的行为，始终追求同一目标， 表明有一个将他们置于绝对专制之下的企图时，他们有权，也有责任摆脱这样的政府，并为他们未来的安全提供新的保障。
Such has been the patient Sufferance off these Colonies; and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.
这些殖民地的耐心忍受，以及现在迫使他们改变以前的政府制度的必要性，就是这样的情况。
The History of the present King of Great-Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, all having in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute Tyranny
over these States.
现在大不列颠国王的历史，就是一连串的伤害和篡夺的历史，其直接目标就是在这些洲之上建立一个绝对的暴政。
To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.
为了证明这一点，让事实向世界公正地提出。
